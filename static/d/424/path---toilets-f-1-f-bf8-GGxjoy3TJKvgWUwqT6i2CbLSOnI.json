For some reason, there are always problems with the toilets.</p>\n<p>At my first programming job there was a guy who would bleed all over the toilet bowl every day, and not clean up the blood.</p>\n<p>At my second programming job, I had to clock out to use the toilets. Also, one time I opened the toilet door to find my boss bending over, wiping his arse.</p>\n<p>At my third programming job, the toilet flushes were so useless that you’d need to flush 5-8 times to get the poo down, and wait 3 minutes between each flush for the cistern to refill. Literally thousands of pounds in engineering time was wasted just because of some crappy toilets.</p>\n<p>At my fourth programming job, there just weren’t enough toilets to go round and one time I overheard two guys in adjacent cubicles having a noisy conversation about their piss up the night before, whilst both shitting really, really loudly.</p>\n<p>At my current programming job, I found a turd that looked like a baby walrus just hunched there in the pan that somebody had left as a surprise. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering and toilets","date":"October 13th, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/toilets/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/etty/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Etty, an Alexa skill for word nerds!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Is-it-safe-privacy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is it safe to go outside? - Privacy Policy"}}}}
